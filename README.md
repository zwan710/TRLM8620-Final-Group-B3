# TRLM8620-Final
## Project Introduction
This represents the localized version of the **Intergalactic Web Shop**, your one-stop destination for rocket parts and space suits. 

Our mission was to take this business global! We have adapted the application to support our customers in **China**. By implementing a robust localization strategy, we ensured that everything from the "Add to Cart" button to the price tags (¥ vs $) feels native to our Chinese users. 

Explore the code to see how we bridged the gap between languages and cultures in a Vue.js environment.

## Part 1: Project Plan
We have created a comprehensive project plan covering the Planning, Design, Development, and Testing phases of localization.
