# TRLM8620-Final

## Project Introduction
This represents the localized version of the **Intergalactic Web Shop**, your one-stop destination for rocket parts and space suits.  

Our mission was to take this business global! We have adapted the application to support our customers in **China**. By implementing a robust localization strategy, we ensured that everything from the "Add to Cart" button to the price tags (¥ vs $) feels native to our Chinese users.  

Explore the code to see how we bridged the gap between languages and cultures in a Vue.js environment.

To view the site locally:

- `cd src`
- `python3 -m http.server`
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Part 1 & Part 3: Project Plan + Reflection
We created a combined slide deck that includes:

- Part 1: Localization project plan (Planning, Design, Development, Testing)
- Part 3: Reflection & learnings (at the end of the same deck)
